class ForceParamotor():
    """
    Class for defining the whole paramotor, which is a combination of the
    airfoil and the motor. 
    The combination is made such that they are "locked" together. 
    How ? By a tension from a connecting string. (the suspentes in real life)
    The model is a system of two masses (the wing and the motor) attached by 
    a string. Each of the masses feels a different total force PLUS the tension
    in the string. 
    
    I developped a generic solution for this type of system, for which I apply 
    to this particular system.
