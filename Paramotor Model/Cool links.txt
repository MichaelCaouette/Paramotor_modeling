For the lift equation:

For a curve of the lift coefficient
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_coefficient


To DO:
Input the Drag and lift coefficient for real value. 

One class for the airfoil. 
One class for the paramotor mass. 
One class for both of them (linked, as a rigid body)
One class to solve F = ma (in 2D or 3D)
